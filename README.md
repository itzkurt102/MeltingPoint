# MeltingPoint

Developed with Unreal Engine 5, Melting Point is a single player Real Time Strategy game where the player is on a mission to save Mars from burning up into a Star. They start with a run-down base and must rebuild it by gathering resources. Once they have their basic base repaired, they must start constructing buildings to help prevent the planet from reaching the planet’s melting point. However, they must also balance protecting their base from hostile creatures with cooling down the environment, since most defenses generate heat. If the player doesn’t protect their base against hostile aliens, they won’t be able to complete their mission.
